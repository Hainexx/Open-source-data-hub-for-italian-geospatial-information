## Open source data hub for italian geospatial information

This project is meant to gather, organize, store and provide all the italian geospacial data in one omnicomprehensive open source repository.

Due to the highly scatteret shape of data across all the different regions, it still is uneasy to acces the data, to compare and to use them in case of emercgencies.

The moving intent is to comply with the Inspire European directive and contribute with a parallel open source project that may be helpful for small sized companies and individuals, as well as reaschers. 
This is only an MVP of a small sample of the Italian territory, Lombardia but the project will be brought forward, hopefully with the aid of whooever would like. 

At the following [Link](https://hainexx.shinyapps.io/Skynet_Inspire/) it is deployed the website connected with the API to instantaneusly download the data for all the towns in Lombardia. 

Otherwise, it is always possible to recreate everything cloning the repo.

### THE INSPIRE PROJECT
The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure for the purposes of EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This European Spatial Data Infrastructure will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe and assist in policy-making across boundaries.
